## Full List of API options

This is the entire list of API options.  There are a huge number, most of which include the needed
details on how to use them.  Also included for each option is the modes that it applies to - please note
that DateBox does not sanity check options - if you pass invalid data, odd things may happen.  
Additionally, if you use an option not meant for the current mode, odd operation may commence.
