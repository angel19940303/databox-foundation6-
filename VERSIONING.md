# DateBox Versioning

This document explains how to change the version of DateBox.


## To bump the version and release

--> edit package.json

{
  "version" : "SemVer"
}
```
___OR___

```sh
# npm version [<new verson>|major|minor|patch]
```

__THEN__

```sh
# npm run build-latest
# npm run release
